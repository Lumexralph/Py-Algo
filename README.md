# Python Algorithms and Data Structures


This repository contains Python based examples of many
popular algorithms and data structure I created while studying and doing
exercises. Some modules will contain repeated code, it was done just to have
each module as a standalone unit without dependencies

Each algorithm and data structure will have its own separate README
with related explanations and links for further reading .
[This is yet to be fully implemented, I will appreciate any help if not done on time.]


## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.



## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is
a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.



## How to use this repository

### Big O Notation

*Big O notation* is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
On the chart below you may find most common orders of growth of algorithms specified in Big O notation.

Below is the list of some of the most used Big O notations and their performance comparisons against different sizes of the input data.

| Big O Notation | Computations for 10 elements | Computations for 100 elements | Computations for 1000 elements  |
